## <p id="11">Question A1</p>

I had my left lower wisdom tooth extracted this morning. Tonight I noticed there was blood in my mouth. Is it still bleeding? What should I do?

## <p id = "12"> Response A1 </p>

It's quite common for patients to experience some bleeding after a wisdom tooth extraction, especially within the first 24 hours. Here's what you should know and do:

1. **Minor Bleeding is Normal**: A certain amount of bleeding is to be expected following surgery. The saliva may be tinged with blood, and this is normal. It may seem like more blood than it actually is due to mixing with saliva.

2. **How to Manage Bleeding**: If you notice active bleeding, you should:
   - Bite on a gauze pad placed directly on the bleeding wound for 30 minutes. Make sure the gauze is positioned so that pressure is applied to the site of the extraction.
   - Avoid rinsing or spitting vigorously, as this can dislodge the blood clot that is forming in the socket, which is essential for healing.
   - Avoid using a straw, smoking, or drinking hot liquids, as these can also disrupt clot formation.

3. **When to be Concerned**: If bleeding is heavy and doesn't subside with pressure using gauze, or if you experience bleeding accompanied by severe pain or swelling, you should contact your oral surgeon or visit an emergency department. Prolonged or excessive bleeding may require additional treatment.

4. **Rest and Elevation**: Try to keep your head elevated and rest. Avoid physical activity, as this can increase bleeding.

Remember, every patient's situation is unique, and if you have specific concerns or if the bleeding seems excessive, it's always best to contact your oral surgeon for personalized advice. They know your case best and can provide the most appropriate guidance.


## <p id = "21"> Question A2</p>

I had my left lower impacted tooth extracted 5 days ago. My face is still swollen today. Is this normal? When do I need to see a doctor for this situation?

## <p id = "22"> Response A2</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I can provide some general guidance on your situation. It's important to remember that every patient's healing process is different, and what you're experiencing may not be unusual.

Five days post-extraction of an impacted tooth, it's not uncommon to still have some swelling. This is part of the body's natural healing process. The peak of swelling typically occurs around the second or third day after surgery and then gradually subsides. However, several factors can influence the duration and severity of swelling, including the complexity of the extraction, the patient's age, general health, and adherence to post-operative instructions.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Cold Compress**: In the first 48 hours after surgery, applying a cold compress can help minimize swelling. After that, warmth may be more beneficial.

2. **Medication**: If you were prescribed anti-inflammatory medication or painkillers, ensure you're taking them as directed.

3. **Rest and Elevation**: Keeping your head elevated, especially when sleeping, and avoiding strenuous activities can help reduce swelling.

4. **Hydration and Diet**: Stay hydrated and follow the dietary advice given by your surgeon, typically soft foods that don’t require much chewing.

5. **Oral Hygiene**: Follow any oral hygiene instructions given to you, but be gentle around the surgical site.

When to see a doctor:

- If the swelling continues to increase after the third day or is significantly worsening.
- If you develop a fever, which could indicate an infection.
- If you experience severe, uncontrolled pain not relieved by prescribed medications.
- If there is excessive bleeding or discharge from the extraction site.
- If you have difficulty swallowing or breathing.

If any of these occur, it's important to contact your oral surgeon or healthcare provider for advice. They may need to see you to assess the situation and provide appropriate care. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and seek professional advice if you're unsure or concerned about your recovery.

## <p id = "31"> Question A3</p>

It's been a week since I had my left lower impacted tooth extracted. The extraction site still hurts now. How should I deal with this? Could it be dry socket?


## <p id = "32"> Response A3</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concerns following an extraction, especially regarding pain and the possibility of a dry socket.

Firstly, it's important to note that some degree of pain and discomfort is normal after a tooth extraction, particularly an impacted one, and can persist for a week or more. However, the pain should gradually lessen with each passing day.

Dry socket, or alveolar osteitis, is a condition that can occur after a tooth extraction when the blood clot at the site of the extraction fails to develop, or it dislodges or dissolves before the wound has healed. It typically presents as a sharp, intense pain that doesn't improve after 3-4 days post-extraction and can sometimes be accompanied by a bad taste or bad breath. This condition usually occurs within 3-5 days after extraction.

To manage your current pain, you should continue to follow post-operative care instructions provided by your surgeon. These often include:

1. **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be effective. Follow the dosing instructions, and if these are insufficient, contact your surgeon for advice.
   
2. **Oral Hygiene**: Gentle rinsing with warm salt water can help keep the extraction site clean. Avoid vigorous rinsing or spitting, which can dislodge the blood clot.

3. **Avoid Certain Activities**: Refrain from smoking and drinking through a straw, as the sucking motion can dislodge the clot. Also, avoid rigorous exercise and heavy lifting, which can increase blood pressure and cause bleeding at the extraction site.

4. **Soft Diet**: Stick to soft foods to avoid disturbing the extraction site. Gradually reintroduce solid foods as you feel comfortable.

5. **Follow-up**: If your pain is worsening or not improving, it's crucial to schedule a follow-up visit. Your surgeon can assess the site to confirm whether it's a normal healing process or if there's a complication like a dry socket.

Remember, every patient's healing process is unique. If you suspect a dry socket or if your pain is severe and unmanageable with over-the-counter medication, it's important to contact your oral surgeon for a follow-up appointment. They might need to clean the extraction site and provide a medicated dressing or prescribe stronger pain medication. Your surgeon is the best resource for managing your recovery and addressing any complications.

## <p id = "41"> Question A4</p>

The tooth extraction left a hole behind. Will it close up? What if food gets stuck there when I eat?

## <p id = "42"> Response A4</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I'd be happy to address your concerns regarding the post-operative healing process after a tooth extraction.

Firstly, it's important to understand that it's completely normal for there to be a hole or socket where the tooth was removed. This hole is a natural part of the healing process. Over time, this hole will gradually fill in with new bone and soft tissue. The healing process varies from person to person, but typically, the soft tissue will start to close over the socket within a few weeks, and complete bone healing may take several months.

To address your concern about food getting stuck in the socket:

1. **Gentle Rinsing**: After 24 hours, gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of water) after meals and before bed. This can help keep the area clean and remove food particles. Avoid vigorous rinsing as it can disturb the healing process.

2. **Eating Habits**: Try to eat soft foods and chew on the opposite side of your mouth to avoid disturbing the extraction site. Gradually reintroduce harder foods as the extraction site heals.

3. **Avoid Certain Foods**: It's advisable to avoid foods that are particularly small, hard, or crunchy (like seeds, nuts, popcorn) in the initial days following surgery, as these can more easily become lodged in the socket.

4. **Oral Hygiene**: Continue with your regular oral hygiene routine, but be gentle around the extraction site. Avoid direct brushing of the area for the first few days to allow for initial healing.

5. **Avoid Smoking and Straws**: Smoking can significantly slow the healing process and should be avoided. Similarly, avoid using straws, as the suction can dislodge the blood clot that forms in the socket, leading to complications like dry socket.

6. **Follow-up**: If you notice anything unusual or if you're concerned about the healing process, don't hesitate to contact your oral surgeon for a follow-up appointment.

Remember, it's normal to experience some discomfort and swelling after a tooth extraction, but this should gradually improve. If you experience severe pain, excessive bleeding, or signs of infection, contact your surgeon immediately.

The key is to maintain good oral hygiene and follow the post-operative instructions provided by your oral surgeon. This will not only promote healing but also minimize the risk of complications.

## <p id = "51"> Question A5</p>

The tooth next to my wisdom tooth got decayed. After the extraction, when can I get the tooth restored?

## <p id = "52"> Response A5</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concern regarding the restoration of the tooth next to your extracted wisdom tooth. First, it's important to remember that healing times can vary from person to person, depending on several factors including the complexity of the extraction, your overall oral health, and how well you follow post-operative care instructions.

Typically, after a wisdom tooth extraction, it's recommended to allow sufficient time for the area to heal before proceeding with restorative procedures on adjacent teeth. The healing process usually involves the formation of a blood clot in the extraction site, followed by the growth of new bone and gum tissue over several weeks to months.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Initial Healing Phase**: The first two weeks after the extraction are crucial for clot formation and initial soft tissue healing. During this period, it's essential to follow all post-operative care instructions to avoid complications like dry socket.

2. **Secondary Healing Phase**: Over the next few weeks to a few months, bone and soft tissue will continue to heal and remodel. This phase is crucial for providing a stable foundation for any restorative work.

3. **Timing for Restoration**: Depending on the condition of the adjacent tooth and the type of restoration planned (like a filling, crown, or implant), your dentist or oral surgeon might recommend waiting anywhere from a few weeks to several months after the extraction. This waiting period allows the area to heal adequately and ensures a better outcome for the restoration.

4. **Individual Variability**: Each person heals differently, so the exact timing for restoration can vary. Your oral health status, age, and habits like smoking can influence the healing process.

5. **Consultation with Your Dentist**: It's essential to have a follow-up consultation with your dentist. They can assess the healing of the extraction site and the condition of the adjacent tooth to give a more personalized recommendation.

6. **Good Oral Hygiene**: Maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial during the healing phase. This helps in preventing further decay in the adjacent teeth and ensures a healthy environment for future restorative work.

Remember, while it might be tempting to rush into restorative procedures, giving your body enough time to heal can lead to a much better long-term outcome. It's always best to follow the specific advice of your dental care provider, as they have the most detailed understanding of your individual situation.

## <p id = "61"> Question A6</p>

I had my left lower wisdom tooth removed a week ago. When can I have the right wisdom tooth removed?

## <p id = "62"> Response A6</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it's important to approach your question with both clinical knowledge and understanding of your concerns. Having your left lower wisdom tooth removed a week ago, you're likely still in the recovery phase from that procedure.

The timing for the removal of another wisdom tooth, like your right lower one, depends on several factors:

1. **Healing from the First Surgery:** It's crucial that the site of your first surgery heals properly before undergoing another surgical procedure. Generally, it might take a few weeks to a few months for complete healing, but this can vary based on individual factors like your overall health, age, and how well you follow post-operative care instructions.

2. **Your Oral Health Status:** If there are no complications from the first surgery and your oral health is good, your surgeon might consider scheduling the next extraction sooner. However, if there are any issues like infection or delayed healing, it would be prudent to wait until these are fully resolved.

3. **Surgeon's Assessment and Recommendation:** Your surgeon will assess the healing of the first extraction site, evaluate the position and condition of the right wisdom tooth, and consider your overall health before making a recommendation. They might also consider factors like your comfort level, any ongoing pain, and your schedule.

4. **Personal Factors:** If you're experiencing discomfort from the remaining wisdom tooth or if it's impacting your oral hygiene, these factors might prompt a slightly earlier second surgery.

Typically, if everything is going well with the healing of the first extraction site, and there are no other contraindications, the second surgery can be planned within a few weeks to a few months. However, the exact timing should be personalized based on your specific situation.

It's also important to maintain good oral hygiene and follow any post-operative instructions provided by your surgeon to aid in your recovery and prepare for the next procedure. If you have any concerns or unusual symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your surgeon.

Remember, the priority is always your health and comfort, so ensuring a complete and complication-free recovery from the first surgery is crucial before proceeding with the next.

## <p id = "71"> Question A7</p>

I had my lower molar extracted 2 weeks ago. When can I get dentures made?

## <p id = "72"> Response A7</p>

It's great that you're thinking ahead about dentures after your lower molar extraction. Typically, the timeline for getting dentures can vary depending on individual healing processes and the specific requirements of your case. However, here's a general guideline:

1. **Healing Period**: After a tooth extraction, it's essential to allow sufficient time for the area to heal before fitting dentures. This period can vary, but for most people, it's usually around 6-8 weeks. This time allows the gums and bone to heal and reshape, which is crucial for the proper fitting of dentures.

2. **Initial Denture Fitting**: Once the extraction site has healed adequately, which is usually determined by your oral surgeon or dentist, preliminary impressions can be made for the fabrication of the dentures. This process might start around the 8-week mark, but again, it can vary.

3. **Adjustments and Final Fitting**: After the initial dentures are made, you may need several appointments for adjustments. These adjustments ensure that the dentures fit comfortably and function properly. It's a process that requires patience, as your mouth adjusts to the new dentures and as the dentures are refined to fit your mouth.

4. **Follow-Up Care**: Regular follow-up visits are important to monitor the fit of the dentures and the health of your gums.

Remember, every individual's situation is unique, and these timelines can vary. It's important to maintain good oral hygiene and follow any specific instructions given by your oral and maxillofacial surgeon or dentist. If you have any concerns or if you experience discomfort, it's crucial to communicate this with your dental professional.

Lastly, getting dentures is a significant step towards restoring function and aesthetics, so it's important to be patient and follow the guidance of your dental care providers for the best outcome.

## <p id = "81"> Question A8</p>

It's been 3 days since my tooth extraction, but I notice the extraction site is increasingly swollen and painful. What's causing this? How should I handle it?

## <p id = "82"> Response A8</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concerns following a tooth extraction. Swelling and pain that increase three days post-extraction can be common, but it's important to monitor these symptoms to ensure they are within normal limits.

The swelling and pain you're experiencing could be due to a normal inflammatory response as your body heals. However, if the swelling and pain are significantly increasing after the third day, it could indicate a complication such as an infection or a condition known as "dry socket" (alveolar osteitis).

Dry socket occurs when the blood clot that forms in the socket to aid in healing is dislodged or dissolves before the wound has healed. This can expose the underlying bone and nerves, leading to increased pain and a risk of infection.

Here's what you should do:

1. **Maintain Oral Hygiene:** Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day. This can help reduce swelling and remove any food particles that might be trapped in the extraction site.

2. **Apply Cold Packs:** For the first 24-48 hours after extraction, applying cold packs to the outside of your face in the area of the extraction can help reduce swelling. After that, switching to warm, moist heat can help decrease discomfort.

3. **Medication:** Continue to take any pain medication or antibiotics as prescribed by your surgeon. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be helpful.

4. **Avoid Certain Activities:** Refrain from smoking, using straws, or any vigorous rinsing or spitting to protect the extraction site.

5. **Monitor Your Symptoms:** If the pain and swelling continue to worsen, or if you develop a fever, foul taste, or persistent bleeding, it's important to contact your surgeon immediately.

Remember, every patient's healing process is different, and your surgeon is best placed to advise you based on your specific situation and medical history. It's always better to err on the side of caution and communicate any concerns with your healthcare provider.

## <p id = "91"> Question A9</p>

I got sutures after my tooth extraction but may not be able to come back to get them removed on time due to work. Can I come a few days later? What's the maximum delay acceptable?

## <p id = "92"> Response A9</p>

If you're unable to come back for suture removal exactly on time after your tooth extraction, it's generally acceptable to have a slight delay. The typical timeframe for suture removal varies depending on several factors, including the complexity of the extraction, the location of the tooth, and your individual healing rate.

1. **Type of Extraction**: Simple extractions usually require sutures to be in place for about 3 to 5 days. More complex surgical extractions might necessitate a longer period, often around 7 to 10 days.

2. **Location of the Extracted Tooth**: Sutures in the front teeth might be removed earlier for aesthetic reasons, whereas those in the back teeth, which endure more chewing forces, might need longer.

3. **Individual Healing Rates**: This varies from person to person. Factors such as age, overall health, and habits like smoking can influence your healing process. 

On average, sutures are typically left in place for about 5 to 10 days following a tooth extraction, allowing adequate time for the site to heal and tissues to knit together properly. However, these timeframes can vary based on the factors mentioned.

It's essential to follow your dentist's post-operative care instructions closely to ensure optimal healing and to avoid complications like dry socket. This includes resting, avoiding smoking, using straws, or probing the extraction site with your tongue, especially in the first 48 hours after the extraction. Maintaining good oral hygiene and continuing with soft foods until complete healing is also crucial.

If you need to delay suture removal due to work or other commitments, it would be best to discuss this with your oral surgeon or dentist. They can advise you on the maximum delay acceptable in your specific case, considering the factors influencing your healing process. It's important to keep in touch with your dental care provider and report any unusual symptoms or concerns you might have during the healing process【5†source】【6†source】.

## <p id = "101"> Question A10</p>

I'm taking Clopidogrel for coronary heart disease. I stopped taking it 3 days before my tooth extraction. When can I resume taking it after operation?

## <p id = "102"> Response A10</p>

I did a [quick search](https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=when%20to%20resume%20clopidogrel%20after%20tooth%20extraction) and here's what I discovered.

Resuming Clopidogrel after a tooth extraction should be approached with caution and is often dependent on individual circumstances. Based on the available information, there is a general consensus that for most dental procedures, including tooth extractions, it is not necessary to alter treatment regimens with antiplatelet agents like Clopidogrel. The risks associated with stopping or reducing these medications, such as thromboembolism, stroke, or myocardial infarction, often outweigh the risks of prolonged bleeding, which can usually be controlled with local measures.

In cases where there are comorbid medical conditions that increase the risk of prolonged bleeding, or if the patient is receiving other therapy that could increase bleeding risks, it's advisable for the dental practitioner to consult with the patient's physician. This consultation will help in determining whether the dental treatment can be safely delivered and if any modification to the medication regimen is needed.

For patients on newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants and undergoing dental interventions, no change to the anticoagulant regimen is generally required. However, in patients at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with comorbid conditions or undergoing more extensive procedures, adjustments might be considered. This could include postponing the timing of the daily dose of the anticoagulant until after the procedure, timing the dental intervention as late as possible after the last dose, or temporarily interrupting the drug therapy for 24 to 48 hours. It's important to note that these decisions should be made in consultation with and on the advice of the patient's physician.

Given these guidelines, it's crucial to consult with your physician about when it's appropriate to resume Clopidogrel after your tooth extraction. They will take into account your specific medical history and the details of your dental procedure to make a tailored recommendation【6†source】【7†source】.

## <p id = "13"> Question B1</p>

It's been a week since I had the biopsy. The results haven't come back yet but I'm quite worried recently. If it turns out to be oral cancer, how should it be treated?

## <p id = "14"> Response B1</p>

I did a [quick search](https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=treatment%20options%20for%20oral%20cancer) and here's what I found.

I understand your concerns about the possibility of oral cancer, and it's normal to feel worried while waiting for biopsy results. If the diagnosis is oral cancer, there are several treatment options available, each tailored to the individual's situation, including the type and stage of the cancer, and your overall health.

The main treatment options for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Let's briefly discuss each:

1. **Surgery**: This is often the first line of treatment, especially for cancers of the oral cavity. The type of surgery depends on the cancer's type, extent, and stage. Surgeons aim to remove all of the cancer, and sometimes lymph nodes are also removed if they are suspected to contain cancer cells.

2. **Radiation Therapy**: This treatment uses powerful energy beams, like X-rays, to kill cancer cells. There are different types of radiation therapy, and your doctors will choose the one that best targets the tumor while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

3. **Chemotherapy**: This involves the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as radiation therapy.

4. **Targeted Therapy**: These are drugs that target specific aspects of cancer cells that make them different from normal cells. They can be used alone or in combination with other treatments.

5. **Immunotherapy**: This treatment boosts your body's own immune system to fight cancer. It works by interfering with the cancer cells' ability to evade the immune system. Drugs like pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) are examples of immunotherapy used in oral cancer.

Each of these treatments can be used alone or in combination, depending on the individual case. It's important to have thorough discussions with your cancer care team about the benefits, risks, and potential side effects of each option. They will guide you in making a decision that aligns with your health needs and preferences.

Remember, each case is unique, so the treatment plan will be specifically tailored to you. Also, seeking a second opinion can be beneficial in understanding your options and feeling more confident about your treatment plan.

For more detailed information, I would recommend visiting resources like the American Cancer Society and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which provide comprehensive overviews of oral cancer treatments.

Please remember, while waiting for your biopsy results, it's important to take care of your mental health as well. Discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare provider, who can offer support and guidance during this challenging time.

I had jaw cyst surgery a week ago. The doctor said I should avoid pathological fractures. How can I prevent that?

## <p id = "24"> Response B2</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, addressing your concerns following jaw cyst surgery is crucial. A week post-surgery is a critical time for healing and avoiding complications like pathological fractures, which are breaks in bones weakened by disease or other conditions—in this case, due to the surgical removal of a cyst.

Here's what you should do to prevent pathological fractures and aid in your recovery:

1. **Follow Dietary Guidelines**: Stick to a soft or liquid diet as recommended by your surgeon. Avoid hard, crunchy, or chewy foods that can exert undue pressure on your jaw.

2. **Limit Physical Activity**: Avoid strenuous activities and sports that might impact your face or jaw. Even activities that cause vigorous jaw movement, like yelling or singing, might be best avoided during the initial healing period.

3. **Use Medications Wisely**: Take any prescribed medications, such as pain relievers or antibiotics, as directed. These help manage pain and prevent infection, both of which can affect the healing process.

4. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Keep your mouth clean to prevent infection. However, be gentle around the surgical site. If you have specific instructions for oral care from your surgeon, follow them closely.

5. **Attend Follow-Up Appointments**: Keep all appointments with your surgeon. They need to monitor your healing and can provide specific advice tailored to your situation.

6. **Avoid Tobacco and Alcohol**: Smoking can impede healing, and alcohol can interact with medications and also affect healing.

7. **Be Mindful of Signs of Complications**: Watch out for symptoms like increased pain, swelling, a fever, or unusual discharge from the surgical site. These could be signs of infection or other complications that need immediate attention.

Remember, everyone's healing process is different. It's important to follow the specific advice given by your surgeon based on your individual case. The primary goal is to allow your jaw to heal properly without additional stress or strain. If you have any concerns or unusual symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider. They are there to help you through your recovery.

## <p id = "33"> Question B3</p>

My daughter had surgery for a lip gland cyst 3 days ago. Will it recur after the surgery?

## <p id = "34"> Response B3</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concern regarding the possibility of recurrence of a lip gland cyst after surgery. First and foremost, it's important to reassure you that the majority of these surgeries are successful, and recurrence is not common.

However, the likelihood of recurrence depends on several factors:

1. **Type of Cyst:** The specific type of glandular cyst can influence recurrence rates. Some types have a higher tendency to recur than others.

2. **Complete Removal:** If the cyst was completely removed during surgery, the chance of recurrence is generally lower. Incomplete removal can lead to a higher risk of the cyst coming back.

3. **Underlying Causes:** Sometimes, cysts are associated with underlying issues. If these are not addressed, there might be a higher chance of recurrence.

4. **Post-Surgical Care:** Proper care following the surgery is crucial. Following the surgeon's instructions for post-operative care, such as keeping the area clean and attending follow-up appointments, can reduce the risk of recurrence.

5. **Individual Healing Response:** Each patient's body reacts differently to surgery. Some people might have a higher propensity for recurrence based on their individual healing processes and genetic factors.

It's also important to keep in mind that regular follow-up visits with the surgeon are essential. These visits allow the surgeon to monitor the healing process and catch any signs of potential recurrence early.

For your peace of mind, it's always good to discuss these concerns directly with your daughter's surgeon. They can provide specific information based on the exact type of cyst and the details of the surgical procedure.

Remember, while there is a possibility of recurrence, most patients do not experience this, especially when they receive appropriate care and follow their surgeon's advice closely. Keep an eye on the surgical site, follow the post-operative instructions, and maintain regular follow-up visits to ensure the best possible outcome.

## <p id = "43"> Question B4</p>

My child just had jaw bone odontoma surgery. How should I care for the oral hygiene and wound?

## <p id = "44"> Response B4</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it's essential to provide comprehensive post-operative care advice to ensure a smooth recovery, especially after jaw bone odontoma surgery in children. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Gentle Oral Hygiene**: It's important to keep the mouth clean to prevent infection. However, be gentle around the surgical site. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and avoid brushing directly on the wound. You can start brushing the other teeth as usual after 24 hours, but be very gentle near the surgical area.

2. **Rinsing**: Avoid rinsing vigorously. If prescribed or recommended, use a saltwater solution (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) or an antiseptic mouthwash. Gently swish the solution around the mouth and let it drip out into the sink without spitting forcefully.

3. **Avoid Certain Foods and Habits**: Stick to soft, easy-to-chew foods. Avoid hard, crunchy, or sticky foods that might irritate the wound. Also, discourage the child from sucking through straws, as this can dislodge blood clots essential for healing.

4. **Hydration and Diet**: Keep your child well-hydrated with water or non-acidic juices. Nutrition is vital for recovery, so ensure they get enough calories and nutrients, which might mean more frequent, smaller meals.

5. **Pain Management**: If pain medication is prescribed, use it as directed. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used, but avoid aspirin or ibuprofen for the first 24 hours as they can increase bleeding.

6. **Swelling and Ice Packs**: Swelling is normal after surgery. You can use ice packs on the outside of the face in the area of the surgery. Apply the ice pack for 15 minutes on and 15 minutes off to help reduce swelling.

7. **Follow-Up Care**: Keep all follow-up appointments with the surgeon to monitor healing and address any concerns.

8. **Watching for Complications**: If you notice excessive bleeding, severe pain not controlled by medication, signs of infection (like increased swelling, redness, warmth, or pus), or any other concerning symptoms, contact your surgeon immediately.

Remember, every surgical procedure and patient is unique, and this advice is general in nature. It's crucial to follow the specific instructions provided by your child's surgeon, as they are tailored to the specific details of their surgery and individual health needs.

## <p id = "53"> Question B5</p>

I just had a gum tumor removal surgery. The doctor said the wound couldn't be sutured so part of the jaw bone was exposed. How should I care for it? Can it heal later?

## <p id = "54"> Response B5</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it's important to provide both accurate medical advice and reassurance to patients following surgeries like gum tumor removal, especially in cases where part of the jaw bone is exposed due to the inability to suture the wound.

## <p id = "15"> Question C1</p>

How to differentiate between dry socket and normal post-extraction pain?

## <p id = "16"> Response C1</p>

Understanding the difference between dry socket (alveolar osteitis) and normal post-extraction pain is important, as the management for each is different.

Here are some key differences to help you differentiate between the two:

1. **Timing of Pain**:
   - **Normal Post-Extraction Pain**: This pain usually peaks within the first 48 hours after extraction and then gradually decreases. It's typically manageable with the prescribed pain medication.
   - **Dry Socket**: This pain often starts 3-4 days after the tooth extraction and can be severe. It doesn't get better with time and can sometimes worsen.

2. **Character of Pain**:
   - **Normal Post-Extraction Pain**: The pain is usually localized to the extraction site and is of a dull, throbbing nature.
   - **Dry Socket**: The pain can be intense, throbbing, and can radiate to your ear, eye, temple, or neck on the same side as the extraction. It's often described as much more severe than the pain felt immediately after the extraction.

3. **Appearance of the Socket**:
   - **Normal Healing Socket**: It will have a blood clot present, which is crucial for healing. The socket might look empty but should have a dark blood clot.
   - **Dry Socket**: The blood clot is dislodged or dissolved, leaving the bone and nerves exposed. The socket appears "dry" and sometimes whitish bone can be seen.

4. **Other Symptoms**:
   - **Normal Post-Extraction Healing**: Besides pain, there might be some swelling and mild discomfort, but these symptoms gradually improve.
   - **Dry Socket**: There may be a bad taste or bad breath due to the exposed bone and tissue within the socket.

5. **Response to Pain Medication**:
   - **Normal Post-Extraction Pain**: Usually responds well to over-the-counter pain relievers or prescribed medication.
   - **Dry Socket**: Often doesn’t respond to regular pain medication, requiring a visit to the dentist for specialized treatment.

If you suspect you have a dry socket, it is important to contact your oral surgeon or dentist as soon as possible. Treatment typically involves cleaning the socket, applying a medicated dressing to promote healing and relieve pain, and possibly prescribing stronger pain medication or antibiotics. 

Remember, while dry socket is a painful condition, it is treatable, and with proper care, it will heal. Your oral surgeon or dentist can provide the best guidance and treatment to ensure a smooth recovery.

## <p id = "25"> Question C2</p>

I have been taking anticoagulant medication for coronary heart disease for a long time. What precautions should I take before tooth extraction? Do I need to stop taking the medication?

## <p id = "26"> Response C2</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concerns about undergoing a tooth extraction while on anticoagulant medication for coronary heart disease. It's important to approach this situation with care, considering both your dental health and your heart condition.

First and foremost, it is crucial not to make any changes to your medication regimen without consulting your cardiologist or the doctor who prescribed your anticoagulants. Anticoagulants are prescribed to prevent blood clots, which are a significant risk in coronary heart disease. Altering or stopping these medications without medical guidance could pose serious risks to your heart health.

In preparation for a tooth extraction, here are some steps you should take:

1. **Consult with Your Cardiologist and Dentist/Surgeon:** Inform both your cardiologist and the oral surgeon about your medication. They will collaborate to determine the safest approach for your extraction. They may request blood tests to assess your clotting status.

2. **Risk Assessment:** Your doctors will evaluate the bleeding risk associated with the dental procedure versus the risk of thromboembolism (formation of a clot in a blood vessel) if your anticoagulant medication is altered. For minor dental procedures like tooth extractions, many patients can safely continue their anticoagulant medication, but this decision is individualized.

3. **Plan the Procedure Appropriately:** If your doctors decide that you can continue taking your anticoagulant, the dental surgeon may use local measures to control bleeding during and after the extraction, such as local hemostatic agents, sutures, and gauze pressure.

4. **Post-Procedure Care:** Follow your surgeon's instructions for post-extraction care, which may include biting on a gauze pad to control bleeding, avoiding certain foods, and not smoking. If any unusual bleeding occurs, contact your surgeon immediately.

5. **Regular Monitoring:** If there's any adjustment in your medication, regular monitoring by your healthcare providers will be necessary to ensure your safety.

6. **Emergency Plan:** Be aware of what to do in case of excessive bleeding or any other complications post-extraction. Your dental surgeon will provide guidelines on when to seek immediate medical attention.

Remember, patient safety is the primary concern, and your healthcare team will work together to ensure that your dental needs are addressed while keeping your overall health in mind.

## <p id = "35"> Question C3</p>

After wisdom tooth removal, my lower lip has been numb. What causes this and how should it be treated? Can it recover?

## <p id = "36"> Response C3</p>

Numbness in the lower lip after wisdom tooth removal, known as paresthesia, is a relatively uncommon but recognized complication. It usually occurs when the surgery involves the lower wisdom teeth (mandibular third molars) due to their proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve, a nerve that provides sensation to the lower lip and chin.

**Causes:**
1. **Nerve Damage:** During the extraction of lower wisdom teeth, the inferior alveolar nerve can be bruised, stretched, or cut, leading to numbness. The risk is higher if the tooth is deeply impacted or close to the nerve.
2. **Inflammation:** Post-surgical swelling can also put pressure on the nerve, causing temporary numbness.

**Treatment and Recovery:**
1. **Observation:** In many cases, the nerve heals on its own over time. This process can take weeks to months. Most patients experience gradual improvement in sensation.
2. **Medication:** Sometimes, medications such as steroids or anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed to reduce swelling and aid in nerve healing.
3. **Vitamin Supplements:** Some surgeons recommend vitamin B complex supplements to support nerve regeneration, though scientific evidence for this is limited.
4. **Follow-Up Visits:** Regular follow-ups with your oral surgeon are important to monitor recovery.
5. **Nerve Repair Surgery:** In rare cases where numbness persists beyond 6 months, a consultation with a nerve repair specialist might be suggested. Surgical intervention to repair the nerve is considered in very few cases.

**Recovery Expectations:**
- The prognosis for nerve recovery varies. Most patients experience some level of improvement over time.
- Complete recovery is possible, especially if the numbness is due to inflammation rather than direct nerve trauma.
- The time frame for recovery can vary from a few weeks to several months. In some rare cases, if the nerve has been severely damaged, the numbness might be permanent.

It's important to keep your oral surgeon informed about the progression of your symptoms. They can provide the most appropriate advice tailored to your specific situation. Additionally, maintaining good oral hygiene and following post-operative care instructions is crucial for healing.

Remember, it's normal to feel concerned about post-surgical symptoms, but your surgeon is there to help guide you through the recovery process. If the numbness is accompanied by other symptoms like pain, significant swelling, or changes in taste, be sure to inform your surgeon promptly.

## <p id = "45"> Question C4</p>

My 6-year-old child's upper incisor failed to erupt due to supernumerary teeth. Now the supernumerary teeth have been removed. Can the incisor still erupt normally?

## <p id = "46"> Response C4</p>

I did a [quick search](https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=supernumerary%20teeth%20removal%20impact%20on%20permanent%20teeth%20eruption%20in%20children) for more information and here's what I discovered.

After the removal of supernumerary teeth, there is a good chance for the impacted incisor to erupt normally, especially in children. A study conducted at the Royal Liverpool Children’s Hospital found that in cases where teeth eruption was delayed due to supernumerary teeth, spontaneous eruption of the impacted tooth occurred in 49% of cases, and eruption within eighteen months following the removal of the supernumerary was observed in 91% of cases. The critical factors in determining if eruption was spontaneous following the removal of the supernumerary were the child's age and space availability in the mouth. 

Given that your child is 6 years old, there is a reasonable expectation that the incisor can still erupt normally, provided there is enough space and no other complications. However, every case is unique, and it's important to keep up regular dental check-ups to monitor the situation closely【47†source】.

## <p id = "55"> Question C5</p>

After surgery for a maxillary cyst, I developed an oral antral fistula. What should be the follow-up treatment?

## <p id = "56"> Response C5</p>

I did a [quick search](https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=oral%20antral%20fistula%20treatment%20after%20maxillary%20cyst%20surgery) and here's what I discovered.

The management of an oral antral fistula (OAF), which can occur after surgery for a maxillary cyst, typically involves surgical intervention. The choice of the surgical technique depends on several factors, including the size of the defect, the health of the surrounding tissues, the condition of the maxillary sinus, and the time since the fistula's formation. Additionally, considerations for any postoperative prosthetic plans, such as dental implants, should be factored into the treatment plan.

Several surgical techniques are available for the closure of OAFs. These include various types of local flaps, such as buccal and palatal flaps, which are commonly used. The palatal flap, for instance, can be executed in different forms, such as mucoperiosteal rotation flap, straight advancement flap, hinged flap, and pedicled island flap. Each of these has specific indications based on the size and location of the fistula.

For instance, the palatal mucoperiosteal rotation flap is often recommended for late repair of oroantral fistula. It involves creating a flap lateral to the vascular supply and then rotating and suturing it to ensure a tension-free closure of the fistula. On the other hand, the palatal straight advancement flap is generally used for minor palatal or alveolar defects due to its limited lateral mobility.

In more complex cases, especially when the health of the involved maxillary sinus is a concern, a combined approach may be necessary. This could involve functional endoscopic sinus surgery along with an intraoral closure technique. The collaboration between oral surgeons and ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialists is crucial in such scenarios to ensure comprehensive management of the condition.

It is important to note that successful closure of an OAF is closely related to the health of the maxillary sinus. If there is impaired drainage or obstruction in the sinus, it may necessitate a more involved surgical approach.

In summary, the management of an oral antral fistula following surgery for a maxillary cyst is a complex process that should be tailored to the individual patient's needs, taking into account the size and location of the fistula, the condition of the surrounding tissues, and the health of the maxillary sinus. Close collaboration between oral and maxillofacial surgeons and ENT specialists is often necessary for optimal treatment outcomes.

## <p id = "65"> Question C6</p>

The dentist broke the root of my wisdom tooth during extraction. He said it can be retained and observed. Is this management plan correct? When should it be removed and when can it be retained?

## <p id = "66"> Response C6</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I can address your concerns about the retained root of a wisdom tooth after extraction. It's not uncommon for the root of a tooth, especially a wisdom tooth, to break during extraction due to the tooth's position or the condition of the root. 

The decision to retain a broken root or remove it depends on several factors:

1. **Location and Position of the Root**: If the root is deeply embedded in the jawbone or close to sensitive structures like nerves or the sinus, it may be safer to leave it in place to avoid potential complications.

2. **Risk of Infection or Cyst Formation**: If there's a significant risk of infection or cyst formation around the retained root, it might be better to remove it. This risk can increase if the tooth was infected prior to extraction.

3. **Patient's Health and Age**: Younger patients with good healing capacity and overall health might be advised differently compared to older patients or those with health conditions that affect bone healing or immune response.

4. **Symptoms**: If the retained root is asymptomatic (not causing pain, infection, or other problems), it might be safe to leave it in place and monitor it. 

5. **Surgeon's Expertise and Experience**: The surgeon's comfort level with the complexity of the removal procedure is also a consideration.

In terms of follow-up and management:

- **Regular Monitoring**: Regular dental check-ups are essential. X-rays might be taken periodically to monitor the status of the root.

- **Symptom Watch**: You should be aware of symptoms like pain, swelling, or changes in sensation around the area, which could indicate a problem.

- **Removal Indications**: Indications for removal include development of infection, cyst formation, or other changes that could affect your oral health.

- **Patient Preferences**: Your preferences and concerns should also be taken into account in the decision-making process.

It's important to maintain open communication with your dentist or oral surgeon. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation. If you have any concerns or if there are changes in your symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your dental care provider for further evaluation and advice.

## <p id = "75"> Question C7</p>

After tooth extraction, I am unable to open my mouth fully. How should this be managed? Can it recover to normal?

## <p id = "76"> Response C7</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it's common to encounter patients experiencing limited mouth opening after a tooth extraction. This condition is known as trismus. Here's how I would address your concern:

1. **Explanation and Reassurance**: First, it's important to understand that trismus after tooth extraction is not uncommon, especially if the surgery was complex or involved your lower wisdom teeth. This limited mouth opening is usually due to muscle spasm or inflammation around the extraction site. It's important to know that in most cases, this condition is temporary and improves with time and proper care.

2. **Management Strategies**:
   - **Warm Compresses**: Applying warm compresses to the affected area can help relax the muscles and reduce discomfort.
   - **Medications**: Over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen, can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.
   - **Jaw Exercises**: Gentle jaw exercises can help improve mouth opening. I recommend starting with small, slow movements, gradually increasing the range of motion as comfort allows.
   - **Soft Diet**: Eating soft foods will reduce the strain on your jaw muscles and help in the healing process.

3. **Follow-Up Care**: It's important to keep any follow-up appointments with your surgeon. They may need to monitor your recovery and provide additional interventions if necessary.

4. **When to Seek Further Help**: If you notice no improvement or worsening of symptoms, increased pain, swelling, or any signs of infection (like fever or pus from the extraction site), contact your surgeon immediately.

5. **Recovery Time**: The time to recover fully can vary depending on the individual case. Most patients see improvement within a few days to a week, but it can take longer in more severe cases.

Remember, every patient's recovery journey is unique, and your surgeon knows the specifics of your case best. So, while these general guidelines can help, your surgeon's tailored advice should be your primary guide.

## <p id = "85"> Question C8</p>

After tooth extraction, I feel pain in the temporomandibular joint when I bite on things. How should this be managed?

## <p id = "86"> Response C8</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand your concern. Pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) following tooth extraction is not uncommon, but it should be managed carefully to ensure your comfort and proper healing.

Firstly, it's important to understand that the TMJ is a complex joint that can be affected by changes in your dental structure, like a tooth extraction. The pain you're experiencing when biting could be due to several factors, including changes in your bite alignment, muscle strain from the procedure, or inflammation in the joint area.

Here are some recommendations to manage this discomfort:

1. **Rest the Jaw**: Try to avoid foods that require heavy chewing for a few days. Soft foods or a liquid diet can help minimize the strain on your TMJ.

2. **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Always follow the dosage instructions and consult with your surgeon if you have any concerns about medications.

3. **Warm or Cold Compresses**: Applying a warm compress can help relax the muscles around the joint, while a cold compress can reduce swelling and pain. Alternate between warm and cold treatments for 10-15 minutes each, several times a day.

4. **Jaw Exercises**: Gentle jaw exercises can help in maintaining mobility and reducing stiffness in the TMJ. However, these should be done only if recommended and guided by your surgeon or a physical therapist.

5. **Avoid Excessive Jaw Movements**: Try to limit activities that cause wide opening of the jaw, such as yawning, shouting, or chewing gum.

6. **Good Oral Hygiene**: Keep the extraction site clean to prevent infection, which could exacerbate TMJ pain. Follow the cleaning instructions given by your surgeon.

7. **Follow-up**: It's crucial to attend follow-up appointments with your surgeon. They can assess the healing process and address any complications early on.

8. **Consider a TMJ Specialist**: If the pain persists or worsens, your surgeon might refer you to a TMJ specialist. They can provide more targeted treatments like physical therapy, custom mouthguards, or other interventions.

Remember, everyone's healing process is different. What's most important is to listen to your body and communicate openly with your healthcare providers about any concerns or persistent symptoms. Your comfort and recovery are the top priorities.

How long after oral surgery can I drink alcohol?

## <p id = "96"> Response C9</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, it's important to give clear and safe advice to patients regarding their post-operative care, including the consumption of alcohol.

Generally, it's recommended to avoid alcohol for at least 24 to 48 hours after oral surgery. This is for several reasons:

1. **Alcohol can interfere with the healing process**: Alcohol can dilate blood vessels and potentially increase bleeding, which can disrupt the initial healing phase. 

2. **Interaction with medications**: Post-surgery, you might be prescribed pain relievers or antibiotics. Alcohol can interact adversely with these medications, either diminishing their effectiveness or exacerbating their side effects.

3. **Dehydration**: Alcohol can cause dehydration, which isn't conducive to healing. Staying hydrated with water is essential for recovery.

4. **Oral sensitivity**: Your mouth may be sensitive or sore after surgery, and alcohol can irritate the surgical site.

The exact duration to avoid alcohol may vary depending on the type of surgery, your overall health, and the specific instructions from your surgeon. In some cases, especially after more complex procedures, you might be advised to avoid alcohol for a longer period.

It's crucial to follow the specific guidelines provided by your oral surgeon, as they are tailored to your individual needs and the specifics of your surgery. Remember, these guidelines are set to ensure the best possible healing and recovery. If you have any specific concerns or if your recovery process is unique in any way, it's always best to consult directly with your surgeon.

## <p id = "105"> Question C10</p>

Are the risks of oral surgery higher for elderly patients compared to younger patients?

## <p id = "106"> Response C10</p>

As an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, I understand the concerns that come with surgery, especially in elderly patients. Yes, the risks associated with oral surgery can be higher for elderly patients compared to younger ones. This difference is primarily due to several factors:

1. **Health Conditions:** Older adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, which can complicate surgery and recovery.

2. **Medication Interactions:** Elderly patients often take multiple medications, which can interact with anesthetics or affect the healing process.

3. **Bone Density:** Age-related changes in bone density can affect the outcomes of surgeries involving bone, such as dental implants.

4. **Healing Time:** The healing process tends to be slower in older adults, which can increase the risk of infection or complications post-surgery.

5. **Dental Health:** Elderly patients might have a history of dental problems, which can complicate oral surgeries.

However, it's important to note that age alone is not a contraindication for oral surgery. A thorough preoperative assessment, including a review of medical history, current medications, and a physical examination, is essential to minimize risks. The surgical plan may be adjusted based on the specific needs and health status of the elderly patient.

As your surgeon, I would ensure that all necessary precautions are taken, and if any specific risks are identified, they will be discussed with you in detail. It's also crucial to follow all post-operative instructions carefully to aid in a smooth recovery.

Remember, our goal is not only the success of the surgery but also your comfort and safety throughout the process. If you have any specific concerns or conditions, please feel free to discuss them with me so we can address them appropriately.
